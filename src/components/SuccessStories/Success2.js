                Caring Hearts has cared for my parents this past 6 years. My parents were both fall risks and my mother had suffered a painful fall at a Care Center. Our family was in desperate need of personal care and we could no longer continue sharing the responsibility of assisting my parents on a 24 hour basis. Caring Hearts literally saved our family and allowed us to enjoy our parents as their children rather than their Caregivers. They are Johnny on the spot! When we called them for help they met with our family and performed the placement the very next day. We have used several Caregivers and they have all been qualified and very professional. The Caregivers we have had have become members of our family. We love them! We would recommend Caring Hearts to anyone. -- Eddie

                My mother was suffering from beginning stages of Dementia and we had placed her in an Assisted Living Home. After a couple of months had gone by we had found that my mothers weight had dropped dramatically and she wouldn't leave her room. The food and care at this facility seemed very average at best. One morning she had a fall and when we arrived to assess what had happened the Care Center gave us very little assurance it wouldn't happen again. A nurse recommended we call Caring Hearts. They met with us that night and we were able to place my mom back in her home that very weekend with a Caregiver. Caring Hearts created a personalized Care Plan for my mom cooking her favorite meals and allowing her to be home where she is thriving. She has gained her weight back and very happy. They are incredibly affordable and fantastic to work with. Knowing that my mother basically has a full time assistant caring for her has truly changed our lives. -- John

                We have been using Caring Hearts for about a year and a half now and we couldn't be happier with the love and care they have provided our family. My sister and I were trading shifts every other week to take care of my mom. Its a full time job! As time went on frustrations began to grow with my sister as to what we believed was the best way to take care of her. She had beginning stages of Dementia and my mother was hard headed and wouldn't listen to us. After interviewing several companies we chose Caring Hearts. They created a personalized Care Plan for my mom and she started to get on a schedule that has allowed her to live her best fullest life with a Caregiver we love! We are so grateful we have had someone loving on my mom day and night. Thank you Caring Hearts! -- Doris

                My husband had suffered a stroke and my partner who was once a vibrant and loving man became victim to his body. His communication skills were limited and he had lost most of his motor activity due to his stroke. One night as I was assisting him down the stairs he collapsed on top of me mid flight and broke my ankle. During the fall he also banged his head and had a large gash. I was an emotional wreck and overwhelmed with the task of taking care of him. Nights were the worst as he would attempt to go to the bathroom on his own at least twice during the night so sleep was very limited for me fearing another fall. I called Caring Hearts and they had a Caregiver placed in my home that very evening! Ever since the Caregiver has been placed I have been able to spend quality time with him and with and get back to my daily routine. The Caregiver cooks, cleans does the daily medication reminders so I can finally get some rest. -- Deborah

                My family was dealt with a very significant blow as my 86 year mother broke her hip. The Doctors and Surgeon we met with told us operating on her at her age was not recommended saying her recovery would be impossible at this stage in her life also considering she had COPD. The Doctors told us she only had a few months to live. We called several companies but most were charging $25 to $35 per hour for full time care. We were not in a situation as a family that we could take care of her on her on a full time basis. One of our acquaintances recommended Caring Hearts. They were so great and affordable! They met with us that afternoon and had a Caregiver placed in our home that same evening. My mother lived for almost a year after the Caregiver was placed. Thank you Caring Hearts! -- Liz

                When it came time that my mom needed full time care and couldn't be left unattended, it was a difficult time for me. There are so many different facilities and companies to choose from. I wanted to be able to have my mom remain in her home where she was comfortable and surrounded by the things and people she loved. I met with several companies and talked with several people. When I met with the people from Caring Hearts I knew they were the company that we wanted. We have been with them for over a year now and very happy with the in home caregivers that we have had. The owners frequently contact me to see if everything is going well and are always available if I need to contact them. I would highly recommend Caring Hearts In Home Care to anyone, to care for their loved one. -- Dixie
