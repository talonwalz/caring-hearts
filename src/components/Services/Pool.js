                <p>Aquatic Therapy is provided by our physical therapy staff in our multi-depth, therapeutic pool at Northern Arizona Rehabilitation & Fitness. It is offered as a modality in conjunction with land based therapy or by itself as the primary therapy if appropriate. Individuals can access the pool either by stairs or a hydraulic lift that uses a chair or stretcher. Depths range from 4 to 6 feet.</p>
